To build music, it is recommended to add the `music.json` configuration file to the web folder during build to generate the static pages:

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="web" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="Config" defaultOpen>
        <File name="music.json" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>

  <Folder name="packages" />
  <File name="package.json" />
</Files>

    ### Install dependencies
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
    <Callout title="Note">
      This will install all dependencies for all the apps and packages which includes `web`, `docs` and `landing`
    </Callout>
  </Step>

    ### Build music only
    Since music is contained in a `monorepo`, it is possible to target the music app specifically to build:


    ```bash
    bunx cross-env NODE_ENV=production DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=containerless bun run build --filter music --force
    ``` 
    <Callout title="Why cross-env?">
      Music is a self-hostable application, and as such, contains a large range of ways we can deploy it. When deploying locally or in a containerless environment, we have to tell music that we do not intent to look for files in places that would suit containerised environments like docker. 
    </Callout>

    <Callout title="Why --force?">
      As we are using specific environments with `cross-env`, [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) does not pick up on a change in environment variables and uses the cached build already generated. The `--force` flag ensures that all builds are clean. 
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Run music
    ```bash
    bunx cross-env NODE_ENV=production DEVELOPMENT_TYPE=containerless bun run start --filter music
    ```

    This will start the production server on port 3000, to change the port, add the `--port` flag
