description: Deploy ParsonLabs Music to a Docker Container
---

We use Docker Compose to orchestrate the deployments of both the frontend and the backend containers.

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" />

  <Folder name="packages" />
  <File name="docker-compose.yml" />
  <File name="docker-compose-dev.yml" />
  <File name="package.json" />
</Files>

In the root of the repository, you will see two files, `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-dev.yml`, these will be used to deploy music on both `production` and `development` environments

## For Production

### Editing docker-compose.yml
To build the app in production, you will need to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./docker/production/Dockerfile.frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - MEDIA_PATH:/Music
      - MISSING_COVER_ART_PATH:/missing_cover_art
      - CONFIG_PATH:/Config
    environment:
      - BACKEND_PORT=3001
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET=SALKDNAKFB@!WQ#
      - NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=docker
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./docker/production/Dockerfile.backend
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - MEDIA_PATH:/Music
      - MISSING_COVER_ART_PATH:/missing_cover_art
      - CONFIG_PATH:/Config
```

More specifically, the volumes `MEDIA_PATH`, `MISSING_COVER_ART_PATH` and `CONFIG_PATH` will need to be mapped to the respective paths on the host system. The `NEXTAUTH_URL` will also need to be changed to the intended redirect url after a user is logged in.

### Starting music in docker-compose
To start music, when the volumes and environment variables have been set, run the command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start both the `frontend` and `backend` containers as a `daemon`.

<Callout title="Info">
  Running the containers as a daemon or detached means that the containers will run in the background and means you can safely exit the console.
</Callout>


## For Development

### Editing docker-compose.yml
To build the app in production, you will need to edit the `docker-compose-dev.yml` file

```yaml title="docker-compose-dev.yml"
version: '3.8'

x-defaults:
  &defaults
  init: true
  tty: true
  networks:
    - monorepo_network

services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./docker/development/Dockerfile.frontend
      args:
        - APP=music
        - DIR_NAME=web
        - START_COMMAND=dev

    command: yarn workspace music dev
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./apps/web:/app/apps/web
      - /app/apps/web/node_modules
      - /app/apps/web/.next
      - /apps/web/node_modules

      - MEDIA_PATH:/Music
      - MISSING_COVER_ART_PATH:/missing_cover_art
      - CONFIG_PATH:/Config
    environment:
      - PORT=3000
      - BACKEND_PORT=3001
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET=SALKDNAKFB@!WQ#
      - NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=docker
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./docker/development/Dockerfile.backend
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - ./apps/web/backend:/app/src 

      - MEDIA_PATH:/Music
      - MISSING_COVER_ART_PATH:/missing_cover_art
      - CONFIG_PATH:/Config
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development

networks:
  monorepo_network:
```


More specifically, the volumes `MEDIA_PATH`, `MISSING_COVER_ART_PATH` and `CONFIG_PATH` will need to be mapped to the respective paths on the host system. The `NEXTAUTH_URL` will also need to be changed to the intended redirect url after a user is logged in.

### Starting music in docker-compose
To start music, when the volumes and environment variables have been set, run the command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```

<Callout title="Note">
  The `-f` flag specifies the dockerfile that Docker Compose will use, by default it will use `docker-compose.yml` and it needs to be before the running command (such as `up` or `down`). If the above does not work, add `COMPOSE_FILE` as an environment variable and the name of the docker compose file for the same function.
