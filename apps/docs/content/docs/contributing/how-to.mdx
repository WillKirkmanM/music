A Guide on finding information that is not covered in the documentation.

## Who does this apply to?
When there is a question you have that is not answered in the documentation, it is most likely not the only time the question will be asked and will need to be put in the documentation

## How To
To ask a question not covered in the Documentation, it is recommended to create a discussion on Github

  <Card 
    href="https://github.com/WillKirkmanM/music/discussions"
    title="Head to the Discussions Page"

</Cards>

<Callout title="Note">
  It is possible that someone with the same question has asked and recieved an answer! Before you ask a question, make sure it hasn't been answered in both [Discussions](https://github.com/WillKirkmanM/music/discussions) and [Issues](https://github.com/WillKirkmanM/music/issues)
