It may be the case where someone has requested a feature in the past, only for it to be clarified as to why it is or is not in music. Check whether this is the case by [heading to the feature request page](https://github.com/WillKirkmanM/music/discussions/categories/feature-request). If this is not the case, feel free to [create a feature request](https://github.com/WillKirkmanM/music/discussions/new?category=feature-request).
